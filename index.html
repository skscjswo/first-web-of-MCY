<h2>Frozen Shoulder란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>Adhesive Capsulitis is commonly referred to as “frozen shoulder.” It is a disorder characterized by pain and loss of motion or stiffness in the shoulder. The cause of frozen shoulder is not fully understood.
<br>The process involves thickening and contracture of the capsule surrounding the shoulder joint. Frozen shoulder can develop after a shoulder is injured or immobilized for a period of time. Attempts to prevent frozen shoulder include early motion of the shoulder after it has been injured.</br>
Frozen shoulder affects about two percent of the general population. It is most common in women between 40-70 years old. It is also associated with a number of medical problems including:</p>
